# lf-demos
This repo contains artifacts such as scripts and sample programs used in demonstrations of Lingua Franca. Each subdirectory corresponds to one LF project, which should contain at least a README.md file with a script of the demo and a `src` directory with each of the LF programs built during the course of the demo.
